# d14 AI Case Project

I tried to my best. I had a very busy week.
Sorry about the some incomplete part, commentless code and not very readable API Documentation and README also Unit Testing.
Unit Testing is maybe my favourite part of the developing. If I had time, I would definitely do my best to.

For the project, just run the application, hibernate will automatically creates and updates db tables.

I used MySQL for RDBMS. In addition, Lombok, DevTools and ModelMapper for DTO mapping.

DB Properties
localhost:3306/d14_db
root/1234

I didn't use the citizen-repository.sql file. This is just for testing.
